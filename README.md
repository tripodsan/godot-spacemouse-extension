## ‚ú® Features

* **6DOF Navigation:** Enjoy precise, simultaneous translation and rotation control over the 3D editor camera.

2.  **Move to Project:** Copy the `addons/spacemouse` folder into the `addons/` directory of your Godot project.
3.  **Enable Plugin:**

  * Go to **Project -> Project Settings...**
  * Navigate to the **Plugins** tab.
  * Find **"Godot Space Mouse"** and ensure its status is set to **"Enable"**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

Once the plugin is enabled, the Space Mouse should automatically begin controlling the 3D viewport camera when the Godot editor is in focus.

### Basic Control

| Action | Space Mouse Control |
| :--- | :--- |
| **6DOF Movement** | The **Controller Cap** (simultaneous translation and rotation) |
| **Recenter/View** | **Button 1** |
| **Toggle Mode** | **Button 2** |

### Button Functionality

* **Button 1 (Recenter/View):**
  * No node selected: Instantly resets the editor camera to the world **origin** (0, 0, 0).
  * Node selected: Frames the camera to a good viewing distance **in front of the currently selected node**.
* **Button 2 (Toggle Mode):** Toggles the navigation mode between **Camera Mode** and **Object Mode**.

### Switching Modes

You can switch between **Camera Mode** and **Object Mode** using **Button 2**.

* **Camera Mode (Default):** Ideal for general scene traversal and exploration.
* **Object Mode:** Perfect for detailed inspection of a specific model or node. Control centers the navigation around the selected object.
